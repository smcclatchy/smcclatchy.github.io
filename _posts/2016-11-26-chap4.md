 expert blind spot
  solution to think through component skills, difficult for expert to identify all
  TA or grad student to help identify more likely to yield results, especially if same person has recently learned the material
  colleagues who teach the material might also suffer from ebs
  someone outside discipline, only if they've learned parts of it / have some knowledge
  
 integration
  practice skills for speed, efficiency & automaticity
  focus on specific parts of the task to develop component skills(s)
  assess integration as a skill in and of itself
 
 transfer
  discuss when and where to apply a skill
  provide opportunities to apply skills and knowledge in different contexts
  discuss how to generalize to overarching principles
  use comparisons to identify deep features
  give example problem and ask for relevant rules, procedures, techniques, approaches
  the reverse: provide skills and knowledge, ask in which situations they might apply
  provide prompts to retrieve relevant knowledge
