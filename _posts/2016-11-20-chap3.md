When I first read the 3rd chapter in How Learning Works, I immediately thought of the medical students that I have taught in recent years. In my experience, medical students are motivated largely by performance goals. They tend to be competitive but not terribly inquisitive. They tend heavily toward performance-approach goals to respond to the demands of the med school curriculum and program, yet don't seem moved by a deep desire to understand medical genetics or the human condition. Their motivation seems to come from learning only what it takes to pass an exam; anything else is viewed as extraneous and is avoided. I'm not the first to notice this characteristic behavior in med students. I've heard professors complain that med students try to drill a hole in their heads to get the answers out, but show little interest in diving deeper into inquiry. I can only hope that once they become practicing physicians they find enough meaning and purpose in their work to ask deeper questions. I'm skeptical of this, however, and avoid doctors as much as possible.

After re-reading the chapter weeks after first digesting it, I've come up with some new insights into the findings it presents. It's good that I put the book down for awhile before writing this post. Some changes have come about at work, and the chapter gave me some insight into how I might approach developing a couple of training programs. I've been asked to put together a proposal for at most two in-house training programs for staff, faculty, and students. We'll start each program with Carpentry training, then follow each with statistics and modeling, and cap each off with advanced content in high-throughput sequence analysis, linear mixed models, or genetic mapping. I'm glad now that I put the book aside for awhile. The timing was right for directly applying information from the book to my work.

expectancy - expect to be successful - we've shown (some of) them how to be successful,
and have shown them that we will meet them at their own level



value - huge value in learning how to code, knowing that they can't learn it on their
own as novices, know that in Bar Harbor no nearby university can support them in
learning how to code or learning how to work with data

demonstrate both e & v and as such are motivated to learn



Carpentry training at the lab meets learning goals - cognitive (recall basic commands, 
practice new skill), affective (experience new way of computing), and social 
(new collaborators from other research labs)

high attainment value - feeling of pride at the end of the 2nd day

intrinsic value is variable - some seem to enjoy coding, others seem to view it as 
a means to an end and not necessarily a pleasurable endeavor

instrumental value - all see Carpentry as a way to move their research forward, some
see the training as a way of achieving job security or moving into a better paid
position

outcome expectancies - expect to be able to apply new skills to tasks in research

efficacy expectancies - it's been hard to convince some people that Carpentry is for
them, even though ads say beginners welcome and no prior programming required; belief
in lack of ability, biologists notoriously unprepared in math; also computer science
in spite of tremendous need for knowledge & skill in biological research

frequent comment that instructors are very helpful and attentive 
believe that environment is supportive
many lack self-efficacy (fragile), won't ask questions for fear of losing face in front of 
colleagues
some become frustrated when coding
small typos are common and are show-stopping; some say they'll never get the hang 
of it, even when typos are pointed out

address value and expectancy by providing flexibility and control - choose one program
or the other, or both; opt-out of requirements that are too easy by completing a brief 
assignment, for example; take only part of the sequence instead of the full sequence in 
the program
