Teaching while ignoring education research is common practice in higher education. There's an unspoken assumption that a Ph.D. bestows teaching powers upon the degree holder, who need only address a group of students in order for learning to happen. Students are held 100% responsible for their own learning. If they didn't learn, they must not have studied hard enough, must not have had the requisite skills and knowledge to begin with, must not have applied themselves to the task. The higher education teacher has no incentive to learn how to teach better, by learning about what works, by being responsive to student needs, or by adapting teaching methods based on education research.

Contrast this with the pre-college teacher's responsibility for student learning. When pre-college teachers ignore research and are unresponsive to their students, property values in their local communities can suffer. There's pressure for schools to hire teachers who can deliver positive results, thereby preserving the property values of the taxpayers who fund teacher salaries. Pre-college teachers typically undergo a year of teacher training based on well-established education research, and implement some evidence-based practices in their teaching.
